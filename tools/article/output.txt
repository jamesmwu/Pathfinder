Besides the pay, internships show to future employers that you have relevant work experience, greatly boosting your resume and chances of future employment. In fact, getting an internship is so important that many regard it as more important than GPA. In this article, we will discuss the process of getting internships, as well as some tips to help you along your journey."

Recruiting season typically takes place the previous fall, with many companies also having a summer recruiting season. Typically, this means you will want to prepare for the interview process as early on as possible. A sample timeline would look like this:"

This means that many CS students end up looking for internships earlier. There are certain programs that are targeted towards underclassmen, like Amazon Propel or FaceBook University. These programs are quite difficult to get in, simply because of the vast amount of applications that these companies receive. Another option for people wishing to get in on the action earlier are startups. Startups are typically less picky, at least about the year requirement. Another option to get involved earlier on is summer research."

Things like graphs, trees, linked lists, and dynamic programming are all common topics seen in interviews. To prepare for these questions, the most commonly used tool is leetcode.com. This site provides a large repository of questions to practice on. Anyone can solve questions on leetcode for free, but some services like solution documents require a premium subscription.

Companies in general look for team players who can cooperate with others, what past experience do you have working with others?

That being said, even if you don't have internship experience, you can still find job opportunities. You might be slightly more limited in the companies that accept you initially, but it is still possible to build a career."
